          This book is intentionally concise. Each chapter is 12–14 pages and
          covers the material for one week of a college course. It is not meant
          to be a comprehensive presentation of Java, but rather, an initial
          exposure to programming constructs and techniques. We begin with small
          problems and basic algorithms and work up to object-oriented design.
          In the vocabulary of computer science pedagogy, this book uses the
          “objects late” approach.

        Think Java is an introduction to computer science and programming
        intended for readers with little or no experience.

        We start with the most basic concepts and are careful to define all
        terms when they are first used. The book presents each new idea in a
        logical progression. Larger topics, like control flow statements and
        object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples and
        introduced over the course of several chapters.

      <p>
        Many of Java’s object-oriented features are motivated by problems with
        previous languages, and their implementations are influenced by this
        history. Some of these features are hard to explain when people aren’t
        familiar with the problems they solve. We get to object-oriented
        programming as quickly as possible (beginning with Chapter 9). But we
        introduce concepts one at a time, as clearly as possible, in a way that
        allows readers to practice each idea in isolation before moving on. So
        it takes some time to get there.
