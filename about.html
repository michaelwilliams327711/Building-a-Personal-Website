      cycling, use of a bicycle for sport, recreation, or transportation. The
      sport of cycling consists of professional and amateur races, which are
      held mostly in continental Europe, the United States, and Asia. The
      recreational use of the bicycle is widespread in Europe and the United
      States. Use of the bicycle as a mode of transportation is particularly
      important in non-Western nations and in flatter countries, some of which,
      like the Netherlands, have a widespread system of bicycle paths.

      The people who make up today’s thriving photographic community are our
      eyes to the world. Whether established artists and journalists or
      passionate emerging voices, they inform us, they inspire us, they amaze
      us, they put our world in the broader context of history. But that
      community also faces great challenges — dwindling sales, increased
      competition and a fragile trust in photographers’ mission to inform. Too
      often, those factors can make those of us in that community, photographers
      and photo editors alike, lose sight of what drive us.

      football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two
      teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and
      arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the
      goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the
      penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.
